* orientation

Features:
* crossXHR
* multiple input/output
* Edit before upload
* Offline (localStorage + manifest)
* DnD
* Fennec


The key features:
* Offline:
    - the application work offline (not on demos.h.m.o *yet*)
    - if you close Firefox or your tab, images are not lost
* Multiple input/output
    - you can open several files at the same time (mutiple input file)
      or draganddrop them
    - you can send all the images at the same time
* Drag'n Drop
    - You can drop the files
    - you can inlay a remote image (from the same domain) or a file from
      your desktop via Drag'n Drop
* Edit before send
    - you can do some operations before sending the files
      (resize, crop, colors, face detector (workers), flip, rotate...)
    - images are resized just after the drop (to do not have to manage a
      huge file)
* Cross-XHR
    - The files (the canvas actually) are upload directly to twitpic, no
      server side code involved

I'm also working on a version for Fennec.
I can say that it's going to work (I have a version here working).
But some features are disabled (face detector and all the DnD stuff).
It supports Orientation events (the design change if you turn you phone).
I use mediaQueries.
